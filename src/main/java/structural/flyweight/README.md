In this example, `AgeInterval` is `intrinsic state` state and name of the country, and coefficients of that 
country are `extrinsic state`.  We could definitely inject also `AgeInterval` into the `Flyweight`
which would be actually better as it is quite static but I wanted to show an example of an `intrinsic state`
so kept it like that.

There are also other points that could be refactored but I leave them as the aim is only to show the 
pattern anyways
